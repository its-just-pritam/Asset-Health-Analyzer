## Getting Started
These instructions will tell you how to obtain a copy of this project up and get it up and running in your local environment for development and/or testing purposes.

## What is it?

This is a simple Todo application that enables the user to add, edit, and delete tasks, view incomplete (active) tasks, and view completed tasks. 

Additionally, it provides routing to a new sample page and has a fail safe "route not found" page for any undefined routes.

## What is the purpose of this project? 

The purpose of this project is to provide a stock/starter point for new Reactjs applications. This code can be modified as necessary for your project's specific needs. It has been supplemented with local pages and with working routes to help start a MPA with built in dependencies.
